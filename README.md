Collections. Practice Task 2
===============
1\. List Wrapper
---------------
Create `java.util.List` wrapper, that consumes 2 collections 
and makes first one unmodifiable. Second part should still be modifiable.

If any modification operation is going to be performed on unmodifiable part of collection,
`IllegalModificationException` should be thrown.

Create Unit tests to test your code. Code coverage should be over 90%.
